# azure-app-service-static-html
Deployed a basic HTML+CSS site to Azure App Service by using the Azure CLI az webapp up command. One can then update the code and redeploy it by using the same command.

The az webapp up command makes it easy to create and update web apps. When executed it performs the following actions:

Create a default resource group if one isn't specified.
Create a default app service plan.
Create an app with the specified name.
Zip deploy files from the current working directory to the web app.
